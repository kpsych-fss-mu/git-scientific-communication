# **After 1st session**

In order for you to strengthen your understanding of Git, I prepared a take-home exercise:

a) Add yourself along with your reviewer to the following sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nscrdZz8rxqHFV8Tbt7bgRYTQzg84uHUjGtiFfx8ECI/edit?usp=sharing
    - Please note that one row equals one pair of reviewer-reviewee. In case somebody doesn't have a reviewer (or does not review somebody's contribution) by December 3 (Saturday), I will resolve this situation

b) Please pull/clone the current version of the git-scientific-communication (https://github.com/kpsych-fss-mu/git-scientific-communication) repository to your local device.

c) Create a new branch and checkout to it.

d) Add a dataset, code, or text that you want to collaborate on to the respective part of the repository (data/code/text)

e) Commit the change, comment on it, push it to the remote version of your local branch, create a pull request, and assign a reviewer (note that you will be a reviewer for that person) to your request.
